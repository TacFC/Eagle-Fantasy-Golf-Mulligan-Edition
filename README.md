# Eagle-Fantasy-Golf-Mulligan-Edition
Eagle Fantasy Golf is a mobile game that went off the app store a while back which used to be one of my favorite past times. the only thing that remains are apk archives of it that when installed are soft locked on the menu screen because its unable to connect to servers. The goal of Eagle Fantasy Golf: Mulligan Edition is to remove the server checks allowing the public to play it once again and possibly allow online matches using Hamatchi.
